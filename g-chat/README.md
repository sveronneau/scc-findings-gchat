# Google Cloud SCC Notifications to Google Chat

This repository contains provides example code to create Finding Notifications for Security Command Center, and sends the findings to Google Chat using a Webhook.

The infrastructure is written in Terraform, which will create the following components:

- [SCC Finding Notifications](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-notifications)
- [Pub/Sub Topic](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub)
- [GCS Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets)
- [GCS Object](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects)
- [Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions)
- [Secrets Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)

The Cloud Function is written in Node.js which will parse the Pub/Sub event and send the details to a Google Chat Webhook using the a Card message with the Google Chat API.


## Prerequisites 

1. Tested on Terraform v1.4.6 with Google Cloud Provider v4.64.0
2. Google Cloud SDK
3. Enable Cloud Functions, Cloud Build, Pub/Sub and Secrets Manager APIs.  
   - gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
   - gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
   - gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com
   - gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
4. Enable Security Command Center (UI)
5. Node.js runtime >= 1.6
6. Create a Google Chat Webhook - info can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/webhooks#create_a_webhook)


## Usage

- Update the terraform.tfvars file with your ORG and PROJECT IDs then deploy using terraform.  
- You will be prompted to enter the Incoming webhook G-Chat URL from step #6 during TF Apply and Deploy.  
- This value will be stored in Secrets Manager.

project_id                      = "CHANGE_ME"
```

## Moving state to a GCS bucket

- Uncomment and Update the backend.tf file with the state bucket name given by the OUTPUT of the Terraform run. (you can also get the value by running: terraform output)
- terraform init -migrate-state

## Moving state back to local

- Comment all of the content of the backend.tf file.
- terraform init -migrate-state
